# collinearity如何影响linear regression的variance
# linear regression的assumptions
  - linearity
  - normality: The error terms (residuals of the model) are normally distributed. This can be checked by plotting a histogram of residuals and see if it forms a bell curve, or a Q-Q plot to see if it follows a straight line. 
  - constant variance
  - independence：The observations are independent of each other. This is important in the context of time series data where this assumption can be violated.
  - no serious multicollinearity: Linear regression assumes that predictors are not perfect linear functions of each other. To check for multicollinearity, we typically use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
