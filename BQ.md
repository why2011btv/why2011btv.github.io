# Amazon

## Tell me about yourself
I'm Haoyu, a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, following Prof. Dan Roth. 
My research focus is primarily on Natural Language Understanding.
Since I joined Dan's group in 2019, I have published more than 10 papers in top conferences.
I believe that is due to my passion about innovation and insisting on the highest standards in my research. 
And that's why I'm very excited about the opportunity to join Amazon as an intern in the coming summer.

## Why Amazon?
Getting hired and building a long-term career at Amazon has been one of my top goals.
Amazon has long been the market leader in numerous industries which tells me it is an organization that is continually progressing and delivers world-class products and services
that outperform its competitors.
This means I will be pushed and challenged in my work, my ideas will be listened to, and I will be supported to be the best I can be.
I also want to work for Amazon because the leadership principles are a set of standards I genuinely believe in, and the inclusive work culture means there is opportunity for everyone.

## Reflect on your last internship, which part could you do better
While I was doing my last internship, my advisor also asked me to do the evaluation quizlets for one of his grants. 

## Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.
SITUATION: When I was preparing for the ECCV submission last month, we had an ongoing problem with communication.
So I was leading the project on creating an evaluation dataset that comprises of 18 multimodal tasks. And I was collaborating with PhD students across multiple institutes.
Updates on projects and task delegation was becoming increasingly difficult as we involve more helpers.
TASK: So I decided to find a simple solution to this issue.
ACTION: After researching online for the best workplace communication and productivity tools, I put together a short presentation on a tool called evernote 
which would empower team members to keep everyone updates on task and project progression.
Furthermore, I set up a bonus for those who proactively complete their tasks and respond to our messages. 
RESULT: After implementation of this method, Evernote became a fundamental part of our workspace productivity scheduling and task management.
And eventually we managed to catch the paper submission deadline.

## What are your strengths and weaknesses?
My greatest strengths include my ability to take ownership of difficult problems and challenges, my cost-conscious approach to work, and my communication skills and confidence which enpower
me to prefessionally challenge key decisions to achieve the best outcomes.
For example, in my current job, I disagreed with my manager on how to crawl the training data from a sandbox web environment.
He insisted that we should use his previous crawling method for mobile UI interaction because it is ready-to-use and the internship is quite short.
After providing several failure examples of using the previous method to back up my claim, he agreed to adopt a new way to crawl.
I then spent 3 days of hardwork on writing the crawling code and started the crawling job with parallelism so that we are still efficient on the task.

My weakness is I find it difficult to say "No" to people. 
I automatically say "YES" when people ask me to get involved in additional tasks or projects when I should first assess my capacity for the extra work.

## Tell me about a time when you influenced a change by only asking questions.

## 有没有在time limit的情况下，完成任务，trade off是什么
I have started working as an intern at google but I also wanted to wrap up one of my previous projects and submit it to ECCV.  
One of my collaborators felt that we should add more tasks into the evaluation benchmark.
However, I believe that Speed matters in both Business and Academia. 
It is not worth it to wait for the next conference since we have included the most significant tasks. 
And I strongly agree with the bias for action in Amazon's leadership principles.
Due to the time limit of paper submission, I sacrificed my time offwork to conduct experiments and write paper, and caught the paper submission deadline eventually. 
It is very important for me to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion.
