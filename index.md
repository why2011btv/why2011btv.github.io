Greetings! I am an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Information Engineering.

I was a visiting student of the [Natural Language Processing group](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu) at UCSB in the summer of 2018, advised by [Prof. William Wang](http://cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) and mentored by [Dr. Vivek Kulkarni](https://viveksck.github.io). I did most of my undergrad research at the Machine Vision and Intelligence Group, advised by [Prof. Cewu Lu](http://mvig.sjtu.edu.cn/index.html). I was also a research assistant at [National Engineering Laboratory for Information Content Analysis Technology](http://nelcat.sjtu.edu.cn/index.html) at SJTU, advised by Prof. Shenghong Li.

I am broadly interested in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. My ultimate academic goal is to design algorithms that are as cognitively capable as human beings in every meaningful dimensions. 

### Research Projects

- Human Pose Tracking: A new method for multi-person pose tracking with spatio-temporal information

- 6D Object Pose Estimation: A novel architecture of detecting 3D model instance and estimating 6D pose under occlusion

- Knowledge Graph Embedding: A new knowledge graph embedding algorithm that captures contextual cues and dependencies among entities and relations
